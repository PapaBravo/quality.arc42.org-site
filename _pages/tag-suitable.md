_Suitable_ might be the most generic term within the Q42 properties.

<div class="arc42-help" markdown="1">

Being right or appropriate for a particular person, purpose, or situation.
</div><br>

Note: In previous versions of Q42, the term "_testable_" was used instead of _suitable_.
Users found that to be overly specific, see the discussion [here](https://github.com/arc42/quality.arc42.org-site/issues/90).


## Definition

>(Functional) Suitability:
>
>...provides functions that meet stated and implied needs when used under specified conditions.
>
>[ISO-25010-2022](/references/#iso-25010-2022)


The ISO restricts _Suitability_ to functional aspects. 
In our opinion it is useful in a broader sense: For example, seen from a testing perspective, suitable can mean "easy to test". 

### "Responsibility" as alternative term

[Bass et. al, 2022](/references/#bass-swa-practice) propose to use the term "responsibility" instead of (functional) suitability.
That is, from our perspective, a matter of taste.
