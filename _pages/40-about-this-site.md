I'm:

* fellow at [INNOQ](https://www.innoq.com),
* quite busy coaching and consulting medium and large-scale enterprises on topics around software architecture and methodical software engineering,
* co-founder and maintainer of <a href="https://www.arc42.de">arc42</a>, the template for pragmatic and systematic software architecture documentation,
* founder of <a href="https://www.aim42.org">aim42</a>, the open source framework for systematic _software architecture improvement_,
* active member and working group lead within the <a href="https://www.isaqb.org">iSAQB</a>,
* regular presenter at IT-conferences,
* author and co-author of more than a dozen books on software architecture, patterns, arc, and the like. I'm really sorry - most of these books are written in German. Have a look at <a href="https://www.leanpub.com">Leanpub</a> for some of my English books.
