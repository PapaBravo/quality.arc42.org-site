## Tooling

* This page is based upon [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static website generator, using a slightly modified version of the [Ttskch](https://github.com/ttskch/jekyll-ttskch-theme) theme.
* It's maintained on [Github](https://github.com/arc42/quality.arc42.org-site/) and published via github-pages.
* An Alpine based Docker container allows for local build- and test of the site

* co-founder and maintainer of <a href="https://www.arc42.de">arc42</a>, the template for pragmatic and systematic software architecture documentation,
* founder of <a href="https://www.aim42.org">aim42</a>, the open source framework for systematic _software architecture improvement_,
