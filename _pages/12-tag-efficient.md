### Definitions


>capable of producing desired results with little or no waste (as of time or materials)

### Effective vs Efficient
>The words effective and efficient both mean "capable of producing a result," but there is an important difference. Effective means "producing a result that is wanted". Efficient means "capable of producing desired results without wasting materials, time, or energy".
>The difference is that when something isÂ effective it produces a result even if it takes some unnecessary resources to do so. When something is efficient, not only does it produce a result, but it does so in a quick or simple way using as little material, time, effort, or energy as possible. The following example sentences show how the two words are used.
>* The 200-page instruction manual was effective [=successful] in teaching the teen to repair the car himself, but it would have been more efficient [=faster and easier] for someone to show him.
>* His disorganized method of cleaning the house was effective but it was not efficient; in the end, the house was clean, but it took much longer than it should have.
>
>The word _effective_ puts more attention on the actual ability to produce a desired result. The word _efficient_ puts more attention on the lack of waste in producing that result.
