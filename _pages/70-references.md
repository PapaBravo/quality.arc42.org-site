### Boehm et al.: Quantitative Evaluation of Software Quality

B. W. Boehm, J. R. Brown, and M. Lipow, ‘Quantitative evaluation of software quality’, in Proceedings of the 2nd international conference on Software engineering, 1976, pp. 592–605.

Available [online](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/800253.807736)

From the abstract:

>A definitive hierarchy of well-defined, well-differentiated characteristics of software quality is developed. 
>Its higher-level structure reflects the actual uses to which software quality evaluation would be put; its lower-level characteristics are closely correlated with actual software metric evaluations which can be performed.

Please note: Boehm's quality model is often (wrongly) dated to a 1978 publication, but in reality the authors published it in 1976.

From this document:

>The purpose of this manual is to present a complete set of procedures and guidelines for introducing and utilizing current software quality measurement techniques in a quality assurance program associated with large-scale software system developments.
>
>These procedures and guidelines will identify:
>
>1. How to identify and specify software quality requirements (Setting Quality Goals).
>2. How and when to apply software metrics (Applying Metrics), and
>3. How to interpret the information obtained from the application of the metrics (Making a Quality Assessment)."
