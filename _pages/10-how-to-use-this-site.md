This site supports you in defining specific quality requirements for your system.

You can approach in several ways:

1. top-down, starting with the eight top-level properties from [Q42, the pragmatical arc42 quality model](/articles/arc42-quality-model)
2. bottom-up, by reading through the [extensive list of qualities](/qualities/).
3. by reading the [examples of quality requirements](/scenarios).

All these approaches are described below.
