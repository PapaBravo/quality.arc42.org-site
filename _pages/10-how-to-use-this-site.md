### Outside-In
The other way round is viable too:
In case your stakeholders have specific requirements, like "compliance":
Just start with the (extensive!) list of [qualities](/qualities/).

Again, you will find related qualities and examples on the detail-pages

### Start with Examples

The third option starts with the [examples of quality requirements](/requirements).
