This site supports you in defining specific quality requirements for your system.

To make the best use, you should become familiar with our terminology.

## Our _Domain Language_

![Q42 meta model](/images/articles/metamodel/product-quality-metamodel.svg)

Let's explain some terms:


| Term | Explanation          |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Property**| Our 8 top-level properties (#flexible, #efficient, #reliable etc.). Find the full list plus the mapping to qualities [**here**](/properties). These terms are highly abstract, and will be interpreted individually by different stakeholders. They are used as starting points. |
| Specific **Quality**| The detailed terms, like  accessibility, accountability, accuracy (and the whole list you find under [**Qualities by Name**](qualities)). These terms are usually well-defined, but not concrete or operational enough to really help in developing systems.  |
| **Examples** and Acceptance Criteria | These are the specific requirements stakeholders have for a system or product. They should enable stakeholders to explicitely determine if anything is _good enough_. |


## How to 
You can approach in several ways:

1. top-down, starting with the eight top-level properties from [Q42, the pragmatical arc42 quality model](/articles/arc42-quality-model)
2. bottom-up, by reading through the [extensive list of qualities](/qualities/).
3. by reading the [examples of quality requirements](/requirements).

All these approaches are described below.

### Inside-Out, starting with Q42 Quality Properties
Let's assume that your stakeholders want a "flexible" system. 
This is completely unsuitable as a requirement because it is too unspecific. 

You could search under the term "#flexible" (to be found under "[Quality Properties](/properties/)".
There you find a collection of related terms ("Qualities tagged with #flexible"), and also a collection of exemplary quality requirements of this generic term.


### Outside-In
The other way round is viable too:
In case your stakeholders have specific requirements, like "compliance":
Just start with the (extensive!) list of [qualities](/qualities/).

Again, you will find related qualities and examples on the detail-pages

### Start with Examples

The third option starts with the [examples of quality requirements](/requirements).
These are
