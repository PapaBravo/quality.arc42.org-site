### Boehm et al: Quantitative Evaluation of Software Quality

B. W. Boehm, J. R. Brown and M. Lipow: Quantitative evaluation of software quality.

ICSE '76: Proceedings of the 2nd international conference on Software engineeringOctober 1976 Pages 592–605, available [online](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/800253.807736)

From the abstract:

>A definitive hierarchy of well-defined, well-differentiated characteristics of software quality is developed. 
>Its higher-level structure reflects the actual uses to which software quality evaluation would be put; its lower-level characteristics are closely correlated with actual software metric evaluations which can be performed.

Please note: Boehm's quality model is often (wrongly) dated to a 1978 publication, but in reality the authors published it 1976.

### McCall/Matsumuto: Software Quality Measurement Manual 

Available [online](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA086986.pdf)

From this document:

>The purpose of this manual is to present a complete set of procedures and guidelines for introducing and utilizing current software quality measurement techniques in a quality assurance program associated with large scale software system developments.
>
>These procedures and guidelines will identify:
>
>1. How to identify and specify software quality requirements (Setting Quality Goals).
>2. How and when to apply software metrics (Applying Metrics), and
>3. How to interpret the information obtained from the application of the metrics (Making a Quality Assessment)."

Nice statement:
