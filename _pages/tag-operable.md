## Typical Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario Response Measures for "Deployability" from [Bass et al.]

Bass et al define [deployability](/qualities/deployability) as a property, and somehow omit other operational characteristics.

>Cost in terms of
>* Number, size and complexity of affected artifacts
>* Average/worst-case effort
>* Elapsed clock or calendar time
>* Money (direct outlay or opportunity cost)
>* New defects introduced
>
>Extend to which this deployment affects other functions or quality attributes.
>* Number of failed deployments
>* Repeatability of the process
>* Traceability of the process
>* Cycle time of the process
