**Background**: Extensions or changes to a subsystem should be possible independently of all other subsystems.


**Stimulus**: Development team changes code or configuration within a subsystem or component... 

**Reaction / Metric**: No other subsystem needs to be changed. The following applies to all other subsystems:
* The source code remains identical
* Compile, build and test processes remain identical
* Deployment, installation and configuration remain identical
