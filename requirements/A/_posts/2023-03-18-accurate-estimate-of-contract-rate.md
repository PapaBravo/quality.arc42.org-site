**Scenario**: A user configures a health insurance contract in the online app.

**Reaction**: The system calculates a price estimate based on the currently available information. 

**Metric**: This estimate must be within a Â±15% margin relative to the final price.

**Background**: The final price of the insurance rate needs to be determined by the backoffice employees of the insurance company due to legal and organizational reasons. This constraint cannot currently be relaxed.
