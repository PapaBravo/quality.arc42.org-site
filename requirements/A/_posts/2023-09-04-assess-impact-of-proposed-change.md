### Stimulus 
A software development team needs to analyse / assess the impact of a proposed change to a specific module of a financial software application.

### Response 
The system's analysability requirement will be considered met when the following precise metrics are achieved:

**Change Impact Assessment Time**: The team should be able to assess the impact of the proposed change within 2 hours of reviewing the relevant documentation and source code.

**Code Comment Density**: The code for the affected module should have a minimum code comment density of 20%, ensuring that code documentation is sufficiently detailed.

**Dependency Mapping**: The system should provide a visual dependency map of the module, indicating all dependencies on other components. The map should be generated within 5 minutes of requesting it.

**Change Simulation**: The system should offer a simulation tool that allows the team to simulate the proposed change's impact on the module's behavior. The simulation should complete within 10 minutes and provide clear results.
