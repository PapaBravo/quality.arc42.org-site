**Stimulus**: User expects/requires to use the keyboard (instead of the mouse) to navigate within the user interface, in all parts of the user interface.

**Reaction**: User can use the system with keyboard-only, without resorting to the mouse or trackpad. 

**Metric**: Keyboard shortcuts are consistent. Functions that are identical or similar in different parts of the system (like "save", "copy", "paste") have identical shortcuts throughout the system.

**Background**: User can use keyboard shortcuts to select and execute functions within the (graphical) user interface.
