Abstract: In November 2023 an updated version of the [ISO 25010 standard on software product quality](https://www.iso.org/standard/35733.html) was released. 
This article describes the major changes and some (still) open issues.


## Overview

First, consider the structure of the _old_ version from 2011:

In our post on the [shortcomings of the ISO-25010:2011](/articles/iso-25010-shortcomings) we complained about the missing _safety_ top-level requirements. At least that glitch has been fixed in the 2023-version:

Please observe some major differences:

* _safety_ has been added (yeah, great!)
* _usability_ has been renamed to _interaction capability_. Might be a matter of taste.
* _portability_ has been renamed to _flexibility_. 

And, to quote the official website:

>* Inclusivity and self-descriptiveness, resistance, and scalability have been added as subcharacteristics of interaction capability, security, and flexibility respectively.
>* User interface aesthetics and maturity have been replaced with user engagement and faultlessness respectively.
>* Accessibility has been split into inclusivity and user assistance.
