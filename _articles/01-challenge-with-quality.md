<div class="arc42-help" markdown="1">
Quality is one of the central topics of development teams. 
Approaches such as _Domain-Driven Design_, help us to get our systems well structured, but performance, robustness, flexibility, security and other important properties are left out. 
Therefore, I propose _Quality-Driven Software Architecture_ as a complement:
A practical approach to achieve essential quality properties.

### What is "Quality"?

We use "quality" colloquially to express something good or positive about products or services. 
For example, we label a piece of clothing, a special meal or even a technical "gadget" as "high quality. 
Unfortunately, we usually remain unspecific as to what exactly we mean by the term "quality" in these cases.

Some time ago, I was allowed to listen to the (rather expensive) over-ear headphones of a British noble manufacturer at a valued colleague's house. 
This led to a lively discussion about what exactly constitutes the "quality" of headphones: 

Is it the
* frequency spectrum achievable by the speakers, 
* maximum achievable volume, 
* comfort while wearing the headphones, 
* weight, 
* type and number of possible connections, 
* faithful reproduction or 
* reproduction optimized for specific music genres, 
* attenuation of external noise (noise cancelling), 
* clean channel separation or 
* operability via gestures or buttons? 
* sustainable and environmentally optimized manufacturing process? 
* a production process free of child labor? 
* ear pads be replaceable? 

And what about durability, longevity or the price?

As you can see, when discussing quality, personal preferences and interests almost inevitably come into play. 
This brings up an interesting feature of quality: it is _highly subjective_.

Try to put this into concrete terms with people you know, talk about the _quality_ of everyday things: 
Tea, coffee, cheese, shoes, pants or even a smartphone: 
The exact characteristics that make up the quality of these things can (sorry, _will surely!_) lead to debates.
