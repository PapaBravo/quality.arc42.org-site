<div class="arc42-help" markdown="1">
Since about 1977, (scientific) minds have been arguing about a conceptual model around the topic of _software product quality_.
A number of authors proposed different approaches, until 1991 the ISO organization took over and began publishing its vendor- and product neutral standards ISO-9126.
In 2011, that was replaced by the ISO-25010, which is still in active use.

Too bad that _active use_ does **not** correspond to practical or usable...

This article presents a few quality models and comes to a (potentially) surprising conclusion...

### A Bit of History

In 1977, McCall suggested to model quality as a hierarchy of terms, whose first level consists of _Operation, Revision_ and _Transition_. To revision he counted e.g. Maintainbility, Flexibility and Testability.

Later, there were a number of alternative proposals, of which, the approaches FURPS ([4]) and its extension FURPS+ by IBM ([5]) found proper acceptance in practice. 

The ISO organization then took up the issue, publishing vendor- and product-neutral standards since 1991, starting with ISO-9126, which "lasted" for 20 years, and was superseded in 2011 by ISO-25010, which is still in effect today. Both were each considered the conceptual reference for software quality, and have gained considerable currency in practice. In my humble opinion, this is largely due to the fact that the ISO bodies define the terms used quite properly. Therefore, they can be forgiven for simply ignoring (or forgetting?) some really relevant quality characteristics.
I also liked quality features of the VOLERE Requirements Template ([6]), which, however, have found less acceptance in the German-speaking world than the ISO standards.
