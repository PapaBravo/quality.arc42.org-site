Published in 2011, the ISO-25010 standard on software product quality, lacks pragmatism and practical applicability. 
This article explains these shortcomings, and shows that even the (draft) update from 2022 still needs polishing... <i class="fa-regular fa-face-frown"></i> 


### ISO 25010 - An Overview
Due to ISO-25010, Software product quality is composed of eight top-level characteristics, which in turn consist of several sub-characteristics. 
Such a hierarchy is structurally very simple, but brings some small problems with it, more on this in a moment. 
All in all, the standard tries to build a generally usable ("generic") taxonomy of almost 40 terms in total - surely all stakeholders should be able to find themselves there. 

During development of a specific system or product, we have to refine that generic model for our system anyway, i.e. describe or demand those characteristics that are relevant for our specific system. 

The diagram shows the top-level characteristics of ISO-25010 in the 2011 version.

### ISO Shortcomings
The current ISO-25010 standard lacks some practical features, such as scalability, deployability, energy efficiency, safety, or code quality.

A recent (Nov. 2022 _draft_) update proposes to add _safety_ and _scalability_, but that is still a draft, and no official standard.
