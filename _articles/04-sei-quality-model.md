Len Bass, Paul Clements and Rick Kazman from the _Software Engineering Institute_ (SEI) have authored the "Software Architecture in Practice" book, which saw its fourth edition in 2022.

A core message within their 400+ page book is the following:

>Software architecture enables system's quality

Within their fourth edition, the authors present a modernized approach to software quality, including concepts like "_deployability_" or "_scalability_".

### What is "Quality"?

>A quality attribute (QA) is a measurable or testable property of a system that is used to indicate how well the system satisfies the needs of its stakeholders beyond the basic function of the system. 
>You can think of a quality attribute as measuring the “utility” of a product along some dimension of interest to a stakeholder.

>[Len Bass et. al, 2022, p. 39](/references)


For Bass and his colleagues, quality consists of 10 major properties, depicted in the following overview.

### Summary
The SEI quality model proposes only 10 major quality attributes, which is a great simplification when compared to the (somewhat bloated) ISO-25010 model (described in detail in [another article](/_articles/iso-25010-shortcomings))
